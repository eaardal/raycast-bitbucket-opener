# BitBucket Opener

Working with lots of repos i BitBucket? Tired of switching to a browser, finding a bookmark, load the page, click on Pipelines or Pull requests a million times a day? Say no more!

This [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) extension lets you type in just the repo name and use shortcuts to open a browser in for example the Pull requests page.

It remembers the _Organization_ and _Default action_ between command invocations, leaving only _Repository name_ to be filled in.

Shortcuts after organization and repository has been filled in:

- `CMD+P`: Open Pipelines
- `CMD+R`: Open Pull requests
- `CMD+H`: Open Home

As usual in Raycast, `CMD+Enter` invokes the default action (lower right corner button) and `CMD+K` opens the menu to see all the actions. The _Default action_ dropdown list controls which action is the default action for that button (letting you choose what you want `CMD+Enter` to do by default).
